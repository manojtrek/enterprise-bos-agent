# Project Title

A flexible framework for integrating, orchestrating, and securing interactions with external APIs. This library leverages agent-based architectures, mesh networking, and OAuth to streamline API communication and management.

## Overview

This project provides:
- **API Integration and Orchestration:** Manage and execute API calls through dedicated agent
- **Mesh Networking:** Coordinate distributed tasks with data mesh agents
- **Support various Access control methods like Basic, JWT,  OAuth:** Handle authentication securely
- **Vectorstore Setup:** Configure and initialize vector databases using for advanced data retrieval and storage.
- **API Registry Integration:** Organize API definitions for standardized interactions.
- **Chainlit Integration:** Includes guidelines and configuration building interactive applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**  
   Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configuration:**  
   - Update environment variables in [`src/.env`](src/.env).
   - Modify settings in the external configuration file ([`config/tools.yaml`](config/tools.yaml)) as needed.

3. **Running the Application:**  
   Launch the application using:
   ```sh
   chainlit run app.py --port 8500
   ```

## Additional Information

- **API Registry:**  
  API definitions and specifications are maintained under the [api-registry](api-registry/) directory.
  
- **Code of Conduct:**  
  Please review the project's guidelines in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Use this repository as a starting point to build robust, secure, and scalable API interaction solutions.
